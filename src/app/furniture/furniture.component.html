        After we finish designing your floor plans, we begin developing a color scheme, a mood board that communicates
        your
        brand message, your taste, our vision, sourcing furniture, fixtures, accessories and materials. Custom furniture
        may
        be designed where needed. Materials for flooring, walls, counters and cabinetry are selected. A lighting concept
        is
        developed. Drawings, samples and conceptual images are gathered. Quotes and pricing are researched. Your needs,
        budget, and brand are all considered in every product and design element we present to you.

        This is where the vision becomes reality. All work by the trades has been completed.Now the furnishings are
        delivered, merchandise is placed and art is hung.
        Accessorizing is what elevates your space to magazine-quality status. It involves adding finishing touches that
        complete your brand message and make your space feel complete. This phase follows a different process than the
        rest of the design. We will purchase the remaining items needed to take your space over the top and prepare them
        for professional photography.
